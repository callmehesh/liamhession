    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
    <div class="box">
        <img src="./resources/images/liam.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="liam"> 
    <p>I'm sure you're itching to know a little about me. So here we go. I finished up my undergrad in 2018 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
            where I majored in Environmental Sciene and Technology Managment. I currently reside in the Bay Area, home of sky high rent, OG rap (I'm looking at you E40), 
            and the best sport teams in the country. Go Giants, Warriors, and Niners! As I'm writing this, I'm working 
            in the Financial district of San Francisco, where I manage the technical support team for Fundbox, a company building the worldâ€™s first B2B payment and credit network. 
            We're striving to disrupt the $21 trillion B2B commerce market, giving the backbone of America's economy, small businesses, the financial freedom to grow. </p>
            <p>Now that you know a little about my work life how about we dive into the things I like to do for fun. I really like surfing and learning new things. 
            Things is a pretty broad term, but seriously, I am open to anything and everything. I am a major extrovert hard set on learning what makes you tick. 
            My 'thing' right now is learning to code, which I'm finding super fun, and best of all, challenging. But, I digress, so, back to surfing. I started surfing 
            when I was 5 and have not stopped since. It's a lifestyle that I hope to pass onto my kids one day. I've yet to experience anything that comes close to the feeling you get after a good wave.
            Surfing has brought me much joy, but also frustration and disappointment, and has taught me to be patient. Most of all, surfing introduced me to the raw power and beauty of our natural world. 
            It has taught me appreciation for the big and the small, shaping me into a compassionate, understanding being. I'll end this stream of conciousness with this: Get out in nature and do something that makes you feel alive. :) </p>
